		<h3>Curiosity, Creativity, Clarity</h3>
		<p>More than just a fun alliteration, these words represent the professional values I bring to everything I work on</p>
		<p>I value clear, helpful communication in all areas, and my intellectual curiosity drives my ability to solve problems creatively</p>
		<p>When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me reading an old book, playing an obscure board game, or concocting a crazy new recipe in the kitchen</p>
