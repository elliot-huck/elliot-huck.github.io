		<h3>Curiosity, Creativity, Clarity</h3>
		<p>
			More than just a fun alliteration, these words represent the professional values I bring to everything I work on
		</p>
		<p>
			I value clear, helpful communication in all areas, and my intellectual curiosity drives my ability to solve
			problems creatively
		</p>
		<p>
			When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me reading an old book, playing an obscure board game, or concocting a crazy new recipe in the kitchen
